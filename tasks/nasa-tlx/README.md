The [NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-TLX) is a self-report measure that measures perceived task difficulty and participant performance.

Note: This version excludes the physical effort question, which is less relevant for most cognitive tasks. Users may want to include this question for online tasks with a physical effort component.
